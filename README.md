## 📘 Introduction

- The Testing Postman using Node.js and Express.js project is designed to help developers understand how to test and debug APIs using Postman.

- It focuses on setting up a minimal Express.js server with a few API routes for testing different HTTP methods.

- Provides insights into handling requests, responses, and middleware in Express.js.

## ✨ Features

🛠 Node.js & Express.js: Simple and efficient backend setup.

🔄 Postman Testing: Easily test API endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

📂 REST API Structure: Well-structured routes for effective API testing.

✅ Middleware Integration: Uses Express middleware for request handling and logging.

⚡ Fast & Lightweight: Minimal dependencies for quick setup and testing.

📱 JSON-based API: Works seamlessly with JSON requests and responses.

## 🛠 Project Implementation Process
